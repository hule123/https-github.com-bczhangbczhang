# Gabor CNNs, Gabor Convolutional Networks

We provide a demo for GCN on MNIST dataset based on **torch7** and also **PyTorch**.

To run this demo, you should  install these dependencies:
```
luarocks install torchnet
luarocks install optnet
```

install GCN:
```bash
cd $DIR/GCN
bash install.sh
```

run this demo:
```bash
cd $DIR/MNIST_demo
bash ./scripts/Train_MNIST.sh
```
To run the pytorch branch, please refer to [this branch](https://github.com/bczhangbczhang/Gabor-Convolutional-Networks/tree/pytorch).

The experimental results of the comparison algorithm are directly quoted from the corresponding papers.
